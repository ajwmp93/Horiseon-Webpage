# AWright Challenge 01

## Description

I began this project to clean up some of the code that was already written in the index.html section by adding semantic tags to certain elements as well as add some alternative text to the images that are displayed on the website to allow a larger user base to use the website. The alternative text will allow people who are visually impaired or who have systems that are not displaying the images clearly to still be able to surmise what the image may be based on the text given. I plan on using this experience to drive my future inclusions of alternative text to make sure that I am being as descriptive and helpful as possible in what I write as well as accurately describe the images displayed. I also plan to use the knowledge I gain and feedback I recieve to continue to create a cleaner code and use semantic tags efficiently and correctly.
